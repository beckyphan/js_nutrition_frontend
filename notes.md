Next steps:
other & stretch:
- user can update their profile to change their nutrition targets
- if user wants to update quantity of foods consumed in their current food log, they can edit quantity (food_log#update)
- if user has an existing log for currentDate, then display upon login
- user will be able to search through foods
- parse date to display in user-friendly format
- display nutritionSums percentage bars as progress bars
- allow user to customize views: background image
- users with new attribute admin will have create/update/destroy capabilities to edit foods in foods table (food#create, food#update, food#destroy)

later version:
- user log will display aggregate food totals instead of separate listings
=> user can add another 5 spears of asparagus, but on the backend user is only able to add unique foods so it actually updates the total # of asparagus within the users' food log

later later version:
- more nutrition values (i.e. fiber, sugar, vitamins, minerals, etc.)
